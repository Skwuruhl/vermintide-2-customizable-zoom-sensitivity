title = "Customizable Zoom Sensitivity";
description = "Adds settings to either scale by focal length or by a different FOV aspect ratio.

Focal length scaling unsuprisingly scales sensitivity by focal length/zoom ratio. This is desirable because if an object appears 2x as large while zoomed in then sensitivity will be scaled by 2x. Example album: https://imgur.com/a/4B1FaVI
Coefficient for this mode is simply a multiplier such that 70% is a 0.7x multiplier to zoom sensitivity.

Custom FOV Aspect Ratio works like Uniform Soldier Aiming from Battlefield or the new Relative ADS sensitivity in Black Ops 4. Basically what it does is use the ratios of FOV of an arbitrary aspect ratio a sensitivity multiplier. A higher value results in higher sensitivity while a lower value approaches focal length scaling.
Coefficient for this mode works such that 100% is ratio of vertical FOV (the game's default scaling method), 177.78% is ratio of 16:9 horizontal fov, 133.33% is ratio of 4:3 horizontal fov.
If you wish to match default CS:GO and Battlefield sensitivity then use a value of 133.33%. If you use USA in Battlefield then you can just use the same value here, except if you use 0% USA then just use focal length with a 100% coefficient.


I personally recommend leaving it to scale by focal length with a 100% coefficient.

Note: If you change your FOV, then the sensitivity won't properly adjust until you go through a load screen or restart the game.
