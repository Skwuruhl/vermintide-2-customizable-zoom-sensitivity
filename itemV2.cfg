title = "Customizable Zoom Sensitivity";
description = "Adds settings to either scale by zoom ratio or by a different FOV ratio. This works like UsA from Battlefield or the new Relative ADS sensitivity in Black Ops 4.

I personally recommend leaving it to scale by zoom ratio (often referred to as 0%), however you can have a more customizable sensitivity with the Custom FOV Ratio Coefficient option. 
With this option you can make sensitivity scale the same way CS:GO does with a custom ratio coefficient of 133%, or return it to vanilla sensitivity with a value of 100%.";
