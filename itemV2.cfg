title = "Customizable Zoom Sensitivity";
description = "Adds settings to either scale by zoom ratio or by monitor distance.

Zoom ratio scaling unsuprisingly scales sensitivity by the zoom ratio or focal length. This is desirable because if an object appears 2x as large while zoomed in then sensitivity will be scaled by 2x. Example album: https://imgur.com/a/4B1FaVI
Coefficient for this mode is simply a multiplier such that 70% is a 0.7x multiplier to zoom sensitivity.
If you use 0 UsA or monitor distance in Battlefield or CoD then use this mode and as the coefficient use your ADS sensitivity multiplier (for most people 100%).
To match CS:GO using this mode go [url=https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x+%3D+1.0+;+x*4%2F9%2F(tan(40*pi%2F360)%2Ftan(90*pi%2F360))]here[/url] and set x to your zoom sensitivity multiplier. Set this to your coefficient. e.g. if wolfram gives me 1.2211 I use a 122.11% coefficient.

Monitor distance works like Uniform Soldier Aiming from Battlefield or the new Relative ADS sensitivity in Black Ops 4. Basically what it does is use the ratios of FOV of an arbitrary aspect ratio as a sensitivity multiplier. A higher value results in higher sensitivity while a lower value approaches zoom ratio scaling.
Coefficient for this mode works such that 100% is ratio of vertical FOV (the game's default scaling method), 177.78% is ratio of 16:9 horizontal fov, 133.33% is ratio of 4:3 horizontal fov.
To match Battlefield or CoD just use your UsA or monitor distance value from those games. Except if you use 0, then switch to zoom ratio with a 100% coefficient.
To match with this mode CS:GO's default use 133.33%


I personally recommend leaving it to scale by zoom ratio with a 100% coefficient.

Note: If you change your FOV, then the sensitivity won't properly adjust until you go through a load screen or restart the game.
